Simpli.fi Looker Code Challenge - Report Writer

The goals of this challenge are:

Use Looker to create one or two dashboards using one or both of the test datasets
 - The dashboards should tell a coherent story about the data
Use Looker's LookML language customize your reporting sandbox (the explores) in order to tell the story that you find interesting about this data
 - Modify the LookML in any way to create new measures or dimensions when creating your dashboards

Development Steps:
 - Sign into Looker using the welcome email that you should have already recieved.
   - It went to the email we have on file.
 - On the develoment tab, you'll find the `Looker Code Challenge` project
   - This will bring you to the code that generates the Explores that you'll be using to build your dashboards
 - Create a view for the `coding_challenge.got_episode_names` table in the database
 - Join that view into the `game_of_thrones` explore in the `looker_code_challenge` model
 - This will allow you to pull in the episode names for the GOT data

Dashboard Steps:
 - Access the explores through the "Explore" dropdown
 - Build out a dashboard or two that tells a story that you find interesting about the data in either or both explores
 - Save the dashboard or dashboards to your personal Folder in Looker

Tips:
 - Feel free to add measures or dimensions
 - Customize labels to make the explore more user friendly
 - Measures can be created using calculations on existing fields
